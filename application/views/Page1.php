		<p>
			Myself Parth Here. Thanks dear for visit this website. Today I will
			tell you Top 10 Things that money can't buy <br> <br> <b><u>1. Love </u></b>:
			Money can buy lust, attraction and power, but it can't buy love. This
			is because love is something intimate; something heartfelt; something
			mysterious. Money is none of these things. Money is simply a method
			of exchange - no more and no less. It's used to pay for a product or
			a service. its convenience, comfort, and luxury - none of which
			typify what human beings truly need. <br> <br> <b><u>2. TRUTH </u></b>:
			Money may be able to buy influence, but truths are the most
			influential of all. Oftentimes money is spent to push beliefs or an
			agenda, and can even be spent to create biased research to bolster an
			opinion. And oftentimes, it's the money that wins in the short term.
			<br> <br> <b><u>3. TIME </u></b>: Each passing minute is time that
			you will never get back; you are one minute closer to dying. This is
			meant to be morbid or depressing, but truthful. Our life starts to
			fade away from the moment we are born. <br> <br> <b><u>4. PEACE </u></b>:
			The cultivation of your thoughts is the only thing that will ever
			bring you true peace. One aspect of this is accepting when bad things
			happen and turning it into a positive experience. <br> <br> <b><u>5.
					TALENT </u></b>: The gifts and abilities that you possess in your
			mind and body are priceless. While money can certain help develop a
			talent, it will never be able to purchase a talent or skill. <br> <br>
			<b><u>6. HEALTH </u></b>: While certainly true that money can
			purchase healthcare and medicine, it cannot replace natural health
			once it's gone. At the same time, activities like exercise,
			preventative medicine, and natural self-care costs little to nothing.
			<br> <br> <b><u>7. MANNER / CLASS </u></b>: Rude people exist across
			the entire income spectrum. How to treat someone in a respectful
			manner obviously does not come from money. Arguably, there are more
			wealthy and entitled snobs than there are those of modest means. <br>
			<br> <b><u>8. TRUE FRIENDS </u></b>: Possessing money may certainly
			attract people who want to be friends, but it doesn't guarantee true
			friendship. Most true friends love one another and what did we
			discuss about money and love? The same concept applies here. <br> <br>
			<b><u>9. KNOWLEDGE </u></b>: The information that you accumulate, the
			elements of your intellect, and the ways that you exhibit wisdom can
			never be bought. Have you ever wondered why some of the wealthiest
			people seem to act in the most asinine ways? This is because money or
			something else has influenced their thought processes. <br> <br> <b><u>10.
					PRESENCE & ACCEPTANCE </u></b>: Perhaps the most important is
			presence and acceptance - the ability to be mindfully present and
			accept, without judgment, each and every situation. This tremendous,
			life-changing gift is not available for purchase; only to those who
			seek to understand and apply the concepts. <br>
